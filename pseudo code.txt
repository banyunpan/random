;loop to find a weakly stable matching

while there is an un-matched tenant:{
	choose an un-matched tenant T
		let T ask the landlord L who owns his highest pref apt. A
		
		if is open, then match A and T
		else if L prefers T over his current T':
			match T and L, T' becomes un-matched
		else T remains unmatched
}

;checks if matching is stable

for each tenant T:{
	if T is not matched with his highest pref apt. A:
		let T ask each of A' that is higher pref than A
			if landlord L of A prefers T more than current tenant T':
				return false; ie, not weakly stable
}
